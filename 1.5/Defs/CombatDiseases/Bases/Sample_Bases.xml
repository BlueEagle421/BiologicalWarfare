  <ThingDef Name="USH_BacteriaSampleBase" Abstract="True" ParentName="USH_DiseaseSampleBase">
    <description>A sample of {0} {1}. When placed in a bacteria incubator, it will grow into multiple {0} pathogen colonies that can later be harvested and used in the production of a biological arsenal.\n\nCan be obtained by using disease sampler on a pawn infected with {0} or crafted from {0} pathogens.</description>
